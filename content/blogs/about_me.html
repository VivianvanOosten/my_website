<p>I am Vivian van Oosten, an enthusiastic data scientist interested in learning more about machine learning applications.</p>
<div id="academics" class="section level2">
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>I majored in Economics and Mathematics for my undergraduate, with a focus on statistics and data science. My favorite course was called Data Analytics for Liberal Arts and Sciences. This was taught by alumni from the programme, who had a passion for data science. The course was a great introduction to the field and sparked my interest to study data science further. Following that, I have taken courses in Machine Learning and Applied Data Science.</p>

<div id="work-experience" class="section level2">
<h2>Work experience</h2>
<p>To experience what working with data is like in a company, I interned at Stater, a mortgage services firm in the Netherlands. I was part of their Data Lab that experiments with data and tries to automate processes and provide insights to the business. I learned the importance of legibility, version control and documentation. As part of the internship, I have applied best practices in terms of code organisation to various applications (Flash and R-Shiny).</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>In my spare time, I love to read and play boardgames. My favorite genre is fantasy, as it provides an amazing escape from reality. If you were looking to try it out, a suggestion would be Assassinâ€™s Apprentice from Robin Hobb.</p>
