<div id="section-shiny-application" class="section level1">
<h1>Shiny application</h1>
<p>We have a spotify dataset with the top 2000 songs from spotify and their characteristics, such as danceability, popularity and various audio qualities. I have built a shiny web application that allows the user to visualise the spotify data and then perform a regression type of their choice. See the shiny application below.</p>
